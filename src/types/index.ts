// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// What the database actually stores.

//

// Session 1 wrote `id: number` because there was no database yet -- the

// mock array in mockData.ts numbered its own rows. MongoDB numbers rows

// itself, with a 24-character hex string, so every id here is a string.

//

// Rather than rewrite the interface, both types below are DERIVED from

// it with Omit -- the utility type from Session 2. Submission stays the

// single source of truth: add a field there and these inherit it.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 

export type UserDoc = Omit<User, "id"> & {

  password: string;

};

 

// studentId is an ObjectId, not a string. An ObjectId is an object that

// PRINTS as 24 hex characters -- it only becomes a real string when the

// document is turned into JSON. Typing it as string here compiles until

// the schema declares it, and then fails on every field at once.

export type SubmissionDoc = Omit<Submission, "id" | "studentId"> & {

  studentId: Types.ObjectId;

};

 

// The body a client sends to create one. No id, and no studentId -- the

// server reads that off the token instead of trusting the request.

export type NewSubmissionBody = Pick<Submission, "courseCode" | "repoUrl">;
